# COMP316 - Computer Vision Assignment

This assignment required the use of Clojure to process a variety of images, of cars, planes and trains, through computer vision techniques to find out how 'similar' images are to each other.

1. Applying Kirch Filters in 8 directions and storing the result in sperate images
2. Gain histogram data from processed images as well as direction histogram
3. Calculate Image descriptor to 'describe the original image.'
4. Go through and match images using their descriptors

See report.pdf for an insight into the code and the results I obtained using the Kirch filters
